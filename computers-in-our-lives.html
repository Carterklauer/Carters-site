    Technology has improved our lives over the years. Computers have positively improved, especially when it was made to be more accessible to a lot of people since Personal Computers were invented. I am currently a Computer Science BA major. During my senior year of High School, my school has started a one on one with Chromebooks. I joined our IT Club my junior year, and we were all in the pilot program the year matter in fact the quarter before it all started. With this epidemic, websites like Zoom, Skype, etc. has been keeping people together, and helps some professors to meet with privatly or have a lecture. Computers are good for keeping up on what's going on, communicating to others, to occupy time, to store files digitally, and in retail, for easy inventory records and that stuff.

    Have you ever wanted to know how long a computer typically lasts? Computers depends on the hardware and the configuration. A computer can last a minimum of 3 years. A couple of things to do is upgrading the RAM storage and switching your HDD to a SSD. Another thing, you can do, is to replace your motherboard, but sometimes it is better to buy a new PC, because replacing parts can be very expensive (Walter, 2019). When I built my desktop computer, I paid around $800 to do it. The year that I built it was 2019, before hyper inflation. Some stuff of what the price includes are both a SSD and a HDD, drives, Motherboard, and Windows 10 Pro. The area that like about the article was that the author states of what you can do as an alternative to replace your computer.

    A good internet access is essential for using a lot of websites; there has been talk about trying to increase broadband capacity to 10Gbps. This innovation of internet connection requires to switch to TWDN.  Some things you will have to do are is switch to the new fiber optics cable, start with one non-tunable 10Gbps wavelength (Fiber optics weekly update, 2015). I did not have internet for around ten years, so around the time of this article. My area did recently got an internet service provider and got internet a year after we got the news. My family and I have a very reliable internet service. We got a few internet streaming services. Since reading this article my thought on it was who would not want faster internet speeds. Internet speeds are increasing as new technologies are invented.
